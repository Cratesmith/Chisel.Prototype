# Chisel.Prototype

This is a *work in progress* prototype for the Chisel level design editor.
It is unfinished, and has bugs.

It requires Unity 2019.1 or higher

Notes:
- Right now a temporary native library is used for the CSG algorithm, this will be replaced by a managed implementation which is currently being developed.
- The native library is x64 and MacOSX only
